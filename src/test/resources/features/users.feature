Feature: User Details and Roles

  Acceptance Criteria:
  A logged in user can find their roles.

  Background:
    Given a user has authenticated with the API

  Scenario Outline: As a logged in user I can find out all my roles
    Given a user has a token name of "<token>"
    When a user role request is made for all roles
    Then the roles returned are "<roles>"

  Examples:
  | token            | roles                                                                          |
  | NORMAL_USER      | BXI_WING_OFF,LEI_WING_OFF,MDI_WING_OFF,NWEB_ACCESS_ROLE_ADMIN,NWEB_KW_ADMIN,NWEB_OMIC_ADMIN,SYI_WING_OFF,WAI_WING_OFF,NWEB_MAINTAIN_ACCESS_ROLES,NWEB_MAINTAIN_ACCESS_ROLES_ADMIN |
  | API_TEST_USER    | MUL_WING_OFF,NWEB_KW_ADMIN,NWEB_OMIC_ADMIN                                                     |

  Scenario Outline: As a logged in user I can find out just my api roles
    Given a user has a token name of "<token>"
    When a user role request is made
    Then the roles returned are "<roles>"

    Examples:
      | token               | roles                |
      | NORMAL_USER         | KW_ADMIN,OMIC_ADMIN,ACCESS_ROLE_ADMIN,MAINTAIN_ACCESS_ROLES,MAINTAIN_ACCESS_ROLES_ADMIN  |
      | API_TEST_USER       | KW_ADMIN,OMIC_ADMIN  |
      | NO_CASELOAD_USER    | VIEW_PRISONER_DATA,LICENCE_RO |

  Scenario: A trusted client can make api-role assignments to users.
    Given a trusted client that can maintain access roles has authenticated with the API
    When the client assigns api-role "KW_ADMIN" to user "API_TEST_USER"
    Then user "API_TEST_USER" has been assigned api-role "KW_ADMIN"

  Scenario: A trusted client can make the same api-role assignments to a user more than once
    Given a trusted client that can maintain access roles has authenticated with the API
    And the client assigns api-role "KW_ADMIN" to user "API_TEST_USER"
    When the client assigns api-role "KW_ADMIN" to user "API_TEST_USER"
    Then user "API_TEST_USER" has been assigned api-role "KW_ADMIN"

  Scenario: A trusted client can make access role assignments to users.
    Given a trusted client that can maintain access roles has authenticated with the API
    When the client assigns access role "ACCESS_ROLE_GENERAL" to user "JBRIEN" for caseload "LEI"
    Then user "JBRIEN" has been assigned access role "ACCESS_ROLE_GENERAL" for caseload "LEI"

  Scenario: A client without Admin priviledges cannot make ADMIN access role assignments to users.
    Given a user has a token name of "LOCAL_ADMIN"
    When the client assigns access role "ACCESS_ROLE_ADMIN" to user "JBRIEN" for caseload "LEI"
    Then the request requiring admin privileges is rejected

  Scenario: A trusted client is prevented from assigning an access role for a user without caseload access.
    Given a user has a token name of "ADMIN_TOKEN"
    When the client assigns access role "ACCESS_ROLE_GENERAL" to user "JBRIEN" for caseload "MDI"
    Then resource not found response is received from users API

  Scenario: A trusted client can remove a role assignment
    Given a user has a token name of "ADMIN_TOKEN"
    And the client assigns api-role "KW_ADMIN" to user "API_TEST_USER"
    When the client removes role "KW_ADMIN" from user "API_TEST_USER" at caseload "NWEB"
    Then user "API_TEST_USER" does not have role "KW_ADMIN" at caseload "NWEB"

  Scenario: A list of staff users by caseload can be retrieved
    Given a user has a token name of "ADMIN_TOKEN"
    When a request for users with caseload "LEI" is made
    Then a list of users is returned with usernames "PRISON_API_USER,ITAG_USER,JBRIEN,NONWEB,RENEGADE,CA_USER,DM_USER,IEP_USER,PPL_USER,UOF_REVIEWER_USER,UOF_COORDINATOR_USER,RCTL_USER,POM_USER,PF_RO_USER,SOC_PRISON_LOCAL,PRISON_COLLATOR_LOCAL,PRISON_ANALYST_LOCAL"

  Scenario: A list of staff users by usernames can be retrieved
    Given a user has a token name of "ADMIN_TOKEN"
    When a request for users with usernames "JBRIEN,RENEGADE" is made
    Then a list of users is returned with usernames "JBRIEN,RENEGADE"

  Scenario: A list of staff users by LAA and namefilter can be retrieved
    Given a user has a token name of "LAA_USER"
    When a request for users by local administrator with namefilter "User" and role "" is made
    Then a list of users is returned with usernames "ITAG_USER,CA_USER,RO_USER"

  Scenario: A list of users by LAA access and namefilter can be retrieved
    Given a user has a token name of "LAA_USER"
    When a request for users by local administrator with namefilter "User" and role "OMIC_ADMIN" is made
    Then a list of users is returned with usernames "ITAG_USER"

  Scenario: A list of staff users by inactive LAA cannot be retrieved
    Given a user has a token name of "PRISON_API_USER"
    When a request for users by local administrator with namefilter "User" and role "" is made
    Then a list of users is returned with usernames ""

  Scenario: A list of staff roles for a user and caseload can be retrieved
    Given a user has authenticated with the API
    When a request for roles for user "ITAG_USER" with caseload "NWEB" is made
    Then a list of roles is returned with role codes "KW_ADMIN,OMIC_ADMIN,MAINTAIN_ACCESS_ROLES_ADMIN,MAINTAIN_ACCESS_ROLES"
