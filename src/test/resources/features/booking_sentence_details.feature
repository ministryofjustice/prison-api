Feature: Booking Sentence Details

  Acceptence Criteria
  A logged on staff user can retrieve sentence details for an offender booking.
  The earliest sentence start date is used when an offender booking has multiple imprisonment sentence terms.
  The latest sentence date calculation record is used when an offender booking has multiple calculation records.
  From the latest sentence date calculation record:
  - if present, the sentence expiry date is the overridden SED value, otherwise it is the calculated SED value.
  - if present, the late term date is the overridden LTD value, otherwise it is the calculated LTD value.
  - if present, the mid term date is the overridden MTD value, otherwise it is the calculated MTD value.
  - if present, the early term date is the overridden ETD value, otherwise it is the calculated ETD value.
  - if present, the automatic release date is the overridden ARD value, otherwise it is the calculated ARD value.
  - if present, the conditional release date is the overridden CRD value, otherwise it is the calculated CRD value.
  - if present, the non-parole date is the overridden NPD value, otherwise it is the calculated NPD value.
  - if present, the post-recall release date is the overridden PRRD value, otherwise it is the calculated PRRD value.
  - if present, the home detention curfew eligibility date is the overridden HDCED value, otherwise it is the calculated HDCED value.
  - if present, the parole eligibility date is the overridden PED value, otherwise it is the calculated PED value.
  - if present, the home detention curfew actual date is the overridden HDCAD value (the calculated HDCAD value is not used).
  - if present, the actual parole date is the overridden APD value (the calculated APD value is not used).
  - if present, the licence expiry date is the overridden LED value, otherwise it is the calculated LED value.
  - if present, the tariff date is the overriden tariff date value, otherwise it is the calculated tariff date value.
  - for NOMIS only, the release on temporary licence date value is the override ROTL value (there is no calculated ROTL value).
  - for NOMIS only, the early removal scheme eligibility date value is the override ERSED value (there is no calculated ERSED value).
  - for NOMIS only, the topup supervision expiry date value is the override TUSED value, otherwise it is the calculated TUSED value.
  - for NOMIS only, the tariff early removal scheme eligibility date is the override TERSED value (there is no calculated TERSED value).
  - the detention training order post recall date is the overriden DPRRD value of present, otherwise the calculated one.
  - the release date for a non-DTO sentence type is derived from one or more of ARD, CRD, NPD and/or PRRD as follows:
  - if more than one ARD, CRD, NPD and/or PRRD value is present (calculated or overridden), the latest date is the release date
  Additional days awarded is the sum of all active sentence adjustment records for an offender booking with the 'ADA' adjustment type.

  Background:
    Given a user has authenticated with the API

  Scenario: Sentence details are requested for booking that does not exist
    When sentence details are requested for an offender with booking id "-99" and version "1.0"
    Then resource not found response is received from sentence details API

  Scenario: Sentence details are requested for booking that is not part of any of logged on staff user's caseloads
    When sentence details are requested for an offender with booking id "-16" and version "1.0"
    Then resource not found response is received from sentence details API

  Scenario: Sentence details are requested for booking that is inactive
    When sentence details are requested for an offender with booking id "-20" and version "1.0"
    Then resource not found response is received from sentence details API
