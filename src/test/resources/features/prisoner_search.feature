Feature: Prisoner Search

  Acceptance Criteria:
  A logged in staff user can search for prisoners across the entire prison system

  Scenario: Can perform global search with GLOBAL_SEARCH role
    Given a user has a token name of "GLOBAL_SEARCH"
    When a search is made for prisoners with DOB on or after 1970-01-01 for range 0 -> 15
    Then "14" prisoner records are returned

  Scenario: Search prisoners within a date of birth range with SYSTEM role
    Given a user has a token name of "GLOBAL_SEARCH"
    When a search is made for prisoners with DOB on or after 1970-01-01 for range 0 -> 2
    Then "2" prisoner records are returned
    And  "14" total prisoner records are available

  Scenario Outline: Search prisoners within a dates of birth range not allowing more than 10 years
    Given a user has a token name of "GLOBAL_SEARCH"
    When a search is made for prisoners with DOB between "<dobFrom>" and "<dobTo>" for range 0 -> 100
    Then "<numberResults>" prisoner records are returned
    And the prisoners dob matches "<DOB>"

    Examples:
    | dobFrom    | dobTo      | numberResults | DOB                                                                                                                      |
