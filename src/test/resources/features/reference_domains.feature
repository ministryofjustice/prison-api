Feature: Reference Domains

  Acceptance Criteria
  A logged on staff user can obtain:
    - a list of all alert types with alert codes (active and/or inactive).
    - a list of all case note sources.
    - a list of case note types (with sub-types) that have been used for creation of offender case notes.
    - a list of reference code items for a specified domain, with or without sub-codes.
    - a single reference code item for a specified domain and code, with or without sub-codes.
  Reference codes without sub-codes are excluded from response when reference codes with sub-codes have been requested.
  A '404 - Resource Not Found' response will be returned:
    - when reference codes, with or without sub-codes, are requested for a reference domain that does not exist.
    - when a reference code, with or without sub-codes, is requested for a reference domain that does not exist.
    - when a reference code, with or without sub-codes, is requested for a reference domain that does exist but for a code that does not.
  A '400 - Bad Request' response will be returned:
    - when a reference code is requested with sub-codes but no sub-codes are defined for the requested reference code.
