  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>A RESTful API service for accessing NOMIS data sets.</p>
  <p>
    All times sent to the API should be sent in local time without the timezone e.g. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.
    All times returned in responses will be in Europe / London local time unless otherwise stated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some endpoints are described as using the Replica database, a read-only copy of the live database which at
    time of writing lags by < 1 second up to approximately 2 seconds. These endpoints are not suitable for use
    by services reacting to events or refreshing web pages where a change has just been made.
  </p>
  <p>
    This service does provide searching capabilities, but can sometimes be slow to return results. A faster search
    is available in the
    <a href="https://prisoner-offender-search-dev.prison.service.justice.gov.uk/swagger-ui/index.html">HMPPS Prisoner Search</a>
    service. This also augments the results from the incentives and restricted patients service. That service should
    be used in preference, with this service only then being used if the data is not available there. Furthermore, the
    Prisoner Search service also provides key prisoner view that could be suitable.
  </p>
  <h2 id="role-restrictions">Access restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    All the API endpoints in Prison API require an access token. Clients can either use the access token from sign into HMPPS Auth, or obtain a token
    by making a client credentials request to HMPPS Auth (with or without an optional username associated with the token).
  </p>
  <p>Access to endpoints are then restricted in two ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Relationship based access. The username (if present) in the token is used to determine what prisons (caseloads) the user is associated with. Each
      prisoner has a current prison location, or is determined to be out of prison or on temporary transfer. If the user also has the 'INACTIVE_BOOKINGS' role
      then they can view prisoner details of prisoners that are out or on temporary transfer. Endpoints or services that restrict in this way will be
      annotated with <code>@VerifyOffenderAccess</code>, <code>@VerifyBookingAccess</code>, depending on whether an offender or booking is passed into
      the method. The <code>@VerifyAgencyAccess</code> is also used to restrict to allowing to see details in a particular prison e.g. for seeing all alerts.
      Sometimes the annotation can be hidden deep into multiple different levels of service so is sometimes difficult to locate. The annotation can also specify
      override roles, so even if the user doesn't have a relationship with the prisoner via a prison then they could still be allowed access via their roles.
    </li>
    <li>
      Role based access. The token will include a number of roles. An endpoint or service can have a <code>@PreAuthorize</code> annotation that restricts access
      to a list of roles.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>New endpoints do try to document what access restrictions are in place, but for old endpoints it is often necessary to look at the source code for
    <a href="https://github.com/ministryofjustice/prison-api">Prison API</a> in github to find that out.</p>

  <p>
    Note also that the endpoints that write data back to NOMIS also often require a write scope in the token. User access tokens will automatically have a
    write scope, but client credentials tokens will often be read scope only unless write has been specifically requested. Write scope endpoints / services
    will either be annotated with <code>@HasWriteScope</code> or the <code>@PreAuthorize</code> will have an extra <code>hasAuthority('SCOPE_write')</code>
    condition.
  </p>

  <p>
    For an example suppose that information about alerts for a list of prisoners is required. The endpoint is '/booking/offenderNo/{agencyId}/alerts'.
    Searching the codebase for that endpoint reveals that it is in <code>BookingResource</code>. The resource endpoint doesn't have any annotations
    restricting access. However it then calls <code>InmateAlertService.getInmateAlertsByOffenderNosAtAgency</code>. This has the following annotation and
    method signature:
  <pre>
      @VerifyAgencyAccess(overrideRoles = {"SYSTEM_USER", "GLOBAL_SEARCH", "VIEW_PRISONER_DATA"})
      public List<Alert> getInmateAlertsByOffenderNosAtAgency(final String agencyId, final List<String> offenderNos) {
    </pre>
  which means that either the token has one of those three roles, or the user associated with the token has <code>agencyId</code> as one of their caseloads.
  </p>
